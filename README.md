# OSCAL Foundation 2025 PlugFest

Welcome to the hub for the technical hackathon portion of the OSCAL Foundation 2025 PlugFest event! 

> [!NOTE]
> **Panels, speakers, and presentations will start at or around 1pm on the Zoom call**, this page is for participants (or those who wish to become participants) in the interoperability testing and hackathon activities.

<br/>


## Hackathon Overview

Our goal is to bring together OSCAL technical experts and implementers for three basic goals:

1. **An opportunity for interoperability testing**
    - Any OSCAL tool that ingests files can test against our set of examples and shared OSCAL documents.
    - Generated OSCAL files - or participants that have OSCAL files already generated - can share them for others to test.

<br/>

2. **Identification of future OSCAL work for the Foundation**
    - Are there places that we can improve the existing OSCAL specification?
    - What additions or changes could we make in the future?

<br/>

3. **Networking and technical discussion**
    - Collaborative problem solving and sharing lessons learned
    - Development and exploration of open-source OSCAL tools

<br/>
